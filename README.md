# Power BI - EcoPower Logistics - Order Monitoring

As the company needs to analyze and visualize the data for it to be seen and interpreted easily, Power Bi is used to do just that. Graphs, tables, cards and other visuals were created so this data is summarized and visualized for easy interpretation.
4 Pages were created namely High-Level metrics for informations that may influence decision making, order monitoring to get information about orders, product monitoring for  information about the products and also customer monitoring to summarize informations about customers over time and other metrics.
Many different graphs were created to interpret easily and look at the information in such a way that anyone who sees it will understand it. There were also filters created if only certain informations needs to be shown on the graphs.
