# EcoPower Logistics Power BI Report Project
Welcome to the EcoPower Logistics Power BI Report Project repository! This project focuses on creating a comprehensive Power BI report to analyze and visualize logistics data for EcoPower Logistics. As a member of the development team, your role is to acquire and practice the necessary skills to create a report that provides valuable insights into customer orders, product sales, and other relevant metrics.

# Overview
EcoPower Logistics provides comprehensive logistics solutions that tackle the complexities of acquiring, storing, and transporting resources and goods globally. Through their logistics management system, orders are received and processed, while the warehouse serves as a secure storage facility. The data stored can be shared in different ways, including visualizations built into a report or dashboard. The company has opted to use Power BI to create a report that allows stakeholders to monitor the status of customers and their orders.

# Project Details
As the company needs to analyze and visualize the data for easy interpretation, Power BI is utilized to create graphs, tables, cards, and other visuals summarizing the data. The report consists of four pages:

High-Level Metrics: Provides information that may influence decision-making.

Order Monitoring: Offers insights into order status and progress.

Product Monitoring: Displays information about product sales and performance.

Customer Monitoring: Summarizes information about customers over time and other relevant metrics.

The report includes various graphs and filters to facilitate easy interpretation and customization of the displayed information. Data is imported from the provided Excel document, and the SQL Server database is connected as a datasource.

SQL Server Database: llaytont-cmpg323.database.windows.net

Due to the fact that I am not a student anymore, the database may not work because the details are deactivated.

# Conclusion
The EcoPower Logistics Power BI Report Project aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into logistics data through comprehensive visualizations and analysis. Thank you for your interest in the project!
